# Physics Simulations using Numerical Methods
 Welcome to my repository where I explore the fascinating world of physics using numerical methods in Julia.ðŸŒ ðŸ’»
 Here I am learning to bridge the gap between the theroetical physics and its real-life applications using computational techniques.  
 I am happy to show some of my most interesting projects related to heat transfer with heat generation, particle motion Haley's Comet simulation. ðŸ’—

 ## Key Focus Areas 
 - Numerical differentiation and integration for first and higher-order differential equations.
 - Solving non-linear systems using Newton's Method.
 - Analysis and solving both Initial Value Problems (IVPs) and Boundary Value Problems (BVPs).
 
 **Boundary Value Problems**
 
 Currently there are two Boundary Value Problem projects related to heat transfer:
 - Heat generation in a cylindrical wire (solved using Euler Method)
 - Spherical object with heat generation (solved using Newton-Raphson Method for nonlinear systems)

 **Initial Value Problems**
 
 This folder contains the following methods and areas of application:
 - Solving first and second order ODE's using Euler Method to demonstrate its simplicity for numerical integration and set the base for understanding more complex methods.
 - Particle Motion Initial Value Problem (using Euler Method for finding the velocity and position of a particle at the next time step)
 - Haley's Comet Trajectory and Velocity Simulation (using second order Taylor expansion).

Every code is carefully commented and the results are visualized and documented along the way.
In the future I hope to include more heat transfer and fluid dynamics - related projects as these are areas I am also highly interested in. I also wish to expand my knowledge of particle physics to be able to simulate particle decays and their detected trajectories.
